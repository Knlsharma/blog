## What Is Behavior Driven Testing?

Behavior Driven Testing (BDT) is an uncommon term in software testing/development compared to Behavior Driven Development (BDD). Behavior-driven development combines the general techniques and principles of TDD with ideas from domain-driven design and object-oriented analysis and design to provide software development and management teams with shared tools and a shared process to collaborate on software development.

BDT is the best choice when you want to show your business point of view and the requirements of the product. To spread out the product ideas, BTD uses very easily understandable language to make sure everyone on the team does not miss anything, even they are non-technical people. Hence, people who are in charge of business analysis and product management can actively join the testing process. Behavior Driven Testing is gaining momentum as lots of organizations are looking at it as a solution to their automation and collaboration challenges. The BDT framework has been successfully implemented by various QA teams in various domains.

# Why Behavior Driven Testing Originated

One of the common downsides when using these frameworks is that it is hard for non-technical people like business analysts and management people to read and understand the test cases, but behavior driven testing can handle it. It has helped to fill the communication gap by writing the test cases in natural language.The scenarios are written to build up a clear understanding of the desired behavior through discussion with stakeholders.
