# What is Jekyll?
**Jekyll** is a _simple, blog-aware, static site generator_ perfect for ***personal, project, or organization sites***. Think of it like a file-based CMS, without all the complexity. Jekyll takes your content, renders _Markdown_ and _Liquid templates_, and spits out a complete, static website ready to be served by Apache, Nginx or another web server.

**Jekyll** is a _simple, extendable, static site generator_. You give it text written in your favorite markup language and it churns through layouts to create a _static website_. Throughout that process you can tweak how you want the site URLs to look, what data gets displayed in the layout, and more.
