The role of a DevOps engineer is not just limited to **CI/CD** and **automating** releases. It's much more than that. **_Long story short â€” automate everything._**

# What Is **DevOps**?

_DevOps_ is a term emerged from the _combination of Development and Operations_. The role of a _DevOps engineer_ is to automate all the _operational work in the way that a developer_ would do. The idea is to encourage frequent releases to increase quality and get early feedback.

# _Advantages_

* Adopt Agile gracefully.
* They automate everything right from the planning phase to the release phase.
* They help the team move faster while maintaining high quality.

# _Main Idea_

> The main idea behind Agile is rapid and frequent delivery. Whatever is _repetitive should be automated_, or try to _reduce the time spent on it_. This should be applicable everywhere in the project.

# _DevOps Toolchain_


**Planning and Analysis**

* Capturing and tracking (JIRA, ServiceNow).
* Documentation or Wiki page (Confluence).
* Collaboration (Slack, HipChat).



**Design and Implementation**

* SCM (Subversion, Git, Mercurial).
* IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, Visual Studio).



**Build and Release (CI/CD)**

* Repository management (Artifactory, Nexus).
* Build tools (Jenkins, Bamboo).
* Configuration management (Chef, Puppet, Ansible).
* Cloud (AWS, Azure, OpenStack).
* Containers (Docker).



**Integration and Testing**

* Source code verification (SonarQube).
* Security testing (HP Fortify).
* Functional testing (JUnit, Cucumber, Selenium).
* Performance testing (SOASTA).



**Operations**

* Monitoring (Splunk).
* Analytics (Adobe Analytics, Flurry, TeaLeaf).
* BI (Kibana, Tableau).

The implementation may differ from organization to organization, as it is highly dependent on management's priorities. It surely helps move things more quickly and maintain high quality.
