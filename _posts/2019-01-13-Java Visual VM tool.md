## Have You Ever Try Out Java Visual VM tool (SE-8) Cool Features!

**Java VisualVM** is a tool that provides a visual interface for viewing detailed information about _Java applications_
while they are running on a **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**, and for troubleshooting and profiling these applications. Various optional tools, including Java VisualVM, are provided with **Sun’s distribution of the Java Development Kit (JDK**) for retrieving different types of data about running JVM software instances. For example,most of the previously standalone tools **JConsole, jstat, jinfo, jstack, and jmap are part of Java VisualVM**. Java VisualVM federates these tools to obtain data from the ***JVM software***, ***then re-organizes and presents the information graphically***, to enable you to view different data about **multiple Java applications uniformly**, whether they are running locally or on remote machines. Furthermore, developers can extend Java VisualVM to add new functionality by creating and **posting plug-ins to the tool’s built-in update center**.

**Java VisualVM** can be used by Java application developers to **troubleshoot applications** and **to monitor and improve the applications’ performance**.Java VisualVM can allow developers to generate and analyze heap dumps, track down memory leaks, browse the platform’s MBeans and perform operations on those MBeans, perform and monitor garbage collection, and perform lightweight memory and CPU profiling.
