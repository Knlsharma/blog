## Rise OF Java (jdk 9)

You may have heard about Java 9â€™s module system, but there's even more to this new version. Here are ten exciting new features that will ship with Java 9.

**1.** **Platform Module System (Project Jigsaw)**:*It is a new kind of Java programing component that can be used to collect Java code (classes and packages)*. The main **goal of this project is** to easily scale down application to small devices. **In Java 9, JDK** itself has divided into set of modules to make it more lightweight. It also allows us to **develop modular applications**.

**2.** **Interface Private Methods**:In Java 9, we **can create private methods inside an interface**. Interface allows us to declare private methods that help to _share common code between non-abstract methods._

Before Java 9, creating private methods inside an interface _cause a compile time error._

**3. Try-With Resources**:Java introduced try-with-resource feature in **Java 7 that helps to close resource** automatically after being used.

In other words, we can say that we don't need to **close resources (file, connection, network etc) explicitly**, try-with-resource close that automatically by using AutoClosable interface.

In Java 7, try-with-resources has a limitation that requires _resource to declare locally within its block._

**4. Anonymous Classes Improvement**:Java 9 introduced a new f**eature that allows us to use diamond operator with anonymous classes**. Using the diamond with anonymous classes was**not allowed in Java 7.**

In Java 9, as long as the inferred type is denotable, **we can use the diamond operator** when we create an _anonymous_ inner class.

**5. Java @SafeVarargs Annotation**:It is an_annotation which applies on a method or constructor_ that takes varargs parameters. It is used to ensure that the method does not perform _unsafe operations on its varargs parameters._

It was included in __**Java 7 and can only be applied on Final, methodsStatic, methodsConstructors**__.

**6. Java Collection Factory Methods**:_Factory methods are special type of static methods that are used to create unmodifiable instances of collections_. It means we can u**se these methods to create list**, set and map of small number of elements.

It is unmodifiable, so adding new element will throw **java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException**

**7. Java Process API Improvement**:Java has improved its **process API in Java 9 version** that helps to manage and control _operating system processes_.

In earlier versions, it was complex to manage and control operating system processes by **using Java programming. Now, new classes and interfaces are added to perform this task**.

**8. Java New Version-String Scheme**:Java version-string is a format that _contains version specific information. This version-string consists of major, minor, security and patch update release_s.

In Java 9, a new **version-string scheme is introduced**.

**9. JShell:** The Java Shell (REPL):*It is an interactive Java Shell tool, it allows us to execute Java code from the shell and shows output immediately. JShell is a REPL (Read Evaluate Print Loop) tool and run from the command line. It is benificial, if we want to test our business logic and get result immediately*.

**10. BeanInfo Annotations**:The _@beaninfo_ Javadoc tag is replaced with the annotation types _JavaBean, BeanProperty, and SwingContainer_.

We can use these attributed directly in the **Bean class**. It also allows auto *removal for automatically created classes and set the corresponding feature attributes during BeanInfo generation at runtime*.


These are many more features to try,So move on to [jdk 9](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk9-downloads-3848520.html)
