## Projects and Experience

The program includes various projects from easy levels to a high level. Mentor's are also available that guide and also helps you to come out form problems states. **Analyzing the task and break it down into small tasks that help in identifying what you have to focus on or not.**

Most of the time I used to do development but this time the projects that I have worked on are related to **data structure and algorithm** this helps me **leaning and clearing the concepts of DS**. My pull request was reviewed by my mentor. My mentor had few suggestions, I fixed them.
