> In tech terms it is the task of ensuring that the declarations and statements of a program are **semantically correct**, i.e, that their **meaning is clear and consistent with the way** in which control structures and **data types** are supposed to be used.

## Associated Major Tasks

**Sentiment analysis** extract subjective information usually from a set of documents, often using online reviews to determine "polarity" about specific objects. It is especially useful for identifying trends of public opinion in the social media, for the purpose of marketing.

**Topic segmentation and recognition** given a chunk of text, separate it into _segments each of which_ is devoted to a topic, and identify the topic of the segment.

**Natural language generation** convert information _from computer databases or semantic intents_into readable human language.

**Question answering** given a human-language question, determine its answer. Typical questions have a specific right answer (such as _"What is the capital of Canada?"_), but sometimes open-ended questions are also considered (such as _"What is the meaning of life?"_).

**Relationship extraction** given a chunk of text, identify the _relationships among named entities_ (e.g. who is married to whom).

**Named entity recognition (NER)** given a stream of text, determine which items in the_text map to proper names, such as people or places,_ and what the type of each such name is (e.g. **person, location, organization**).

                                        or
               a formal address or discourse delivered to an audience.
               
## Associated Tasks

**Speech recognition** given a sound clip of a person or people speaking, determine the textual representation of the speech. This is the opposite of _text to speech_ and is one of the extremely difficult problems colloquially termed "AI-complete". In natural speech there are hardly any pauses between successive words, and thus _speech segmentation is a necessary subtask of speech recognition_ (see below). Note also that in most spoken languages, the sounds representing successive letters blend into each other in a process termed _coarticulation_.

**Speech segmentation** given a sound clip of a person or people speaking, s_eparate it into words_. A subtask of _speech recognition_ and typically grouped with it.

**Text-to-speech** given a text, transform those _units_ and _produce a spoken representation_. Text-to-speech can be used to aid the visually impaired.
