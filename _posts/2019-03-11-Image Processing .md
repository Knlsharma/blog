# Introduction to Digital Image Processing

Digital Image Processing means processing digital image by means of a digital computer. We can also say that it is a use of computer algorithms, in order to get enhanced image either to extract some useful information.

> **Technical Def:** An _image_ is defined as a two-dimensional function,F(x,y), where x and y are _spatial coordinates_, and the a_mplitude of F_ at any pair of coordinates (x,y) is called the intensity of that image at that point. When x,y, and amplitude values of F are finite, we call it a **_digital image_**.

# Types of an image

**1. Binary Image** as its name suggests, contain only two pixel elements i.e 0 & 1,where **0 refers to black and 1 refers to white.** This image is also known as **Monochrome.**

**2. Black and White Image** which consist of only **_black and white color is called Black and White Image._**

**3. 8 bit Color Format** is the most _famous image format_.It has 256 different shades of colors in it and commonly known as Grayscale Image. In this format,**0 stands for Black, and 255 stands for white, and 127 stands for gray.**

**4. 16 bit Color Format** is a _color image format_. It has 65,536 different colors in it.It is **also known as High Color Format. In this format the distribution of color is not as same as Grayscale image.**

A **16 bit format** is actually divided into **three further** formats which are **Red**, **Green** and **Blue**. That famous **RGB** format.

The remaining tasks will be in 2nd post out soon.
