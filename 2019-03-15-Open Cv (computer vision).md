Today every company handle a lot of image data and also perform various tasks on the image as per requirements such as extraction, analysis etc. So there is one name which is OpenCV which is a cross-platform library using which we can develop real-time computer vision applications. It mainly focuses on image processing, video capture and analysis including features like face detection and object detection.

## Computer Vision

_Computer Vision_ can be defined as a discipline that explains how to _reconstruct, interrupt, and understand a 3D scene from its 2D images_, in terms of the properties of the structure present in the scene. It deals with modeling and replicating _human vision_ using _computer software and hardware_.

## Computer Vision overlaps significantly with the following fields −

* **Image Processing −**It focuses on image manipulation.

* **Pattern Recognition −** It explains various techniques to classify patterns.

* **Photogrammetry −** It is concerned with obtaining accurate measurements from images.

## Computer Vision Vs Image Processing

**Image processing** deals with image-to-image transformation. The input and output of image processing are both images.

**Computer vision** is the construction of explicit, meaningful descriptions of physical objects from their image. The output of computer vision is a description or an interpretation of structures in 3D scene.


## Applications of Computer Vision

* 2D and 3D feature toolkits
* Egomotion estimation
* Facial recognition system
* Gesture recognition
* Human–computer interaction (HCI)
* Mobile robotics
* Motion understanding

**OpenCV** was originally developed in _**C++**_. In addition to it, _Python and Java bindings_ were provided. _OpenCV runs on various Operating Systems such as windows, Linux, OSx, FreeBSD, Net BSD, Open BSD, etc._

_There is a well documented source about its implementation where you can read details link is in references._
